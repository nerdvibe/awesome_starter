# ðŸŽ© awesome_starterðŸŽ¢
A simple NodeJS starter kit featuring better logging, multiple prototypes for strings, arrays, objects, numbers and dates.

### Why?
Nobody likes to repeat themselfs. Here is my package with the most common helpers that I use.

# How to install & use:

- `$ npm install -S awesome_starter`
- In your main js file require awesome_starter with `require('awesome_starter');`

# Features:

### Logs:
 - New logs methods. console.success() and console.fail()
 - Timestamp on every log
 - Colors for different log levels

### General Error handling:
A simple function `generalCatchCallback()` that throws a console.error when is needed. E.g. when you have to write many .catch()

### Multiple prototypes for the types:
Check the folder `prototypes/`
